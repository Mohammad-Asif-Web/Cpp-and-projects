# programming C and C++ 
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.<br>
C++ is most useful language for Game Developing, Desktop app, operating systems etc. It is a compiler language. which is developed from C. It is faster than C Program
This repository will guide you to learn C programming basic with examples and projects. I have used C++ for Problem Solving knowledge, Data Structure and Algorithm

## Why Learn C/C++ Programming?
This language will helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.<br>After learning this language, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, php, perl, ruby, javascript etc.<br>Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C and C++ 

## How Computer Execute the code?
The code we write in the IDE or Code Editor to execute is called Source Code. The Traslator Program convert the source code to Binary Code and our computer understand this Binary code. 

Translator Program is 3 Types:-
- Assembly 
- Compiler 
- Interpreter

**Compiler pragramming language:** C, C++, Objective-C, C#, Pascal. The compiler Read the Source code. If there is an error, The compiler show us list of Errors and If there is no Error the compiler convert the codes to Object code. It is fast

**Interpreter Programming Language:** Python, PHP, Javascript, Perl, Ruby. The Interpreter works like same as compiler do. But It reads code line by line and give output from it. it is slow

## Header Files
It is very Important to have proper knowledge about Header Files. Because all the functions are include in header files. Otherwise the functions are don't execute properly.

**C header files:**

**C++ header files:**
