## About C Programming
Procedural Language - Instructions in a C program are executed step by step.
Portable - You can move C programs from one platform to another, and run it without any or minimal changes.<br>Speed - C programming is faster than most programming languages like Java, Python, etc.<br>General Purpose - C programming can be used to develop operating systems, embedded systems, databases, and so on.

## Why Learn C Programming
C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.<br>After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.<br>Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.
